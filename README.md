# Android-app launch checklist


This document should be a collaborative effort from the groups. 
The groups must construct and finish the app launch checklist.

Each group will have 3 topics to research and present @ 10.30.

The point of presenting these topics is to involve the students and to better understand the concept when releasing an app on the
Google store.

To find each subject go to http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/launch-checklist.html and learn more.

##1. Understand the Publishing Process

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

##10. Build and Upload the Release-ready APK

To be able to upload your application to the Google Play marketplace, you'll need to export it as an **APK (Android Package)** file.

This can be achieved by using Android Studio's build in function **"Generate Signed APK"**. Just like in Windows we have an .exe file, in Android we have an .apk file for running the application, so Google Play needs a file to distribute. Android requires that all apps be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed; therefore, your application will require a release key generated in the export process - you define it in the **"New Key Store"** section. 

This preparation process, as well as the cleanup and optimization of your code, is a required development task and is the first step in publishing your application.

##11. Plan a Beta Release

Testing of your application helps to ensure that your application runs properly under realistic device and network conditions, while gathering suggestions on improvements and bugs. Google Play provides secure means to do that in its **Developer Console**, but for a feedback mechanism, you'll need to consider integrating it yourself or using Google Forums. 

The key to a successful beta test is finding the people to with the right knowledge that are committed to the product and still being able to motnitor their every move. Google offers a beta testing tool for getting as much feedback as possible, but you can consider different platforms, like TestFlight, Crashyltics Beta, HockeyApp with different analytic features.
