##1. Understand the Publishing Process

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

##7. Consider using In-app Billing or Android Pay
Google Play In-app Billing lets you sell digital content in your applications, ranging from one-time purchases to subscriptions. This can help you to monetize the app over its installed lifetime.

###In-app billing & subscriptions
In-app Billing lets you sell to sell a wide range of digital content, including downloadable content such as media files or photos, virtual content such as game levels or potions, premium services and features, and more. In-app billing can be sold as:
* Standard in-app products (one-time billing), or
* Subscriptions (recurring, automated billing)

Subscriptions let you sell content, services, or features in your app with automated, recurring billing. An existing In-app Billing implementation can easily be adapted to sell subscriptions. You can sell subscriptions to almost any type of digital content, from any type of app or game.

Users can be billed
* Weekly
* Monthly
* 3 months
* 6 months
* Annually
* Seasonal

Any application that you publish through Google Play can implement In-app Billing. No special account or registration is required other than a Google Play Developer Console account and a Google Wallet merchant account.

To help integrate in-app billing, the Android SDK provides a sample application that demonstrates to implement in-app billing.

###Android pay
Android Pay enables simple and secure purchases of physical goods and services in your app, such as clothing, food delivery or movie tickets.
